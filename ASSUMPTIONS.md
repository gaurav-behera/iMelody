## Assumptions

1. The website is designed to be accessed primarily from desktop or laptop computers (1920x1080), rather than a mobile device.
2. The website designed as of now only contains a few artists, albums, and songs, but this will be extended to a huge database in the later stages of the project.
3. The featured artist section on the home page doesn't update weekly.
4. The search page can be used to search for only songs.
6. The user profile and it's functionalities have also not yet been implemented.
7. The reviews and ratings are not stored in any database and refreshing the page empties all previous reviews.

Most of these will be implemented in the future at later phases.
