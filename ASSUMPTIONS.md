## Assumptions

1. The website is designed to be accessed primarily from desktop or laptop computers (1920x1080), rather than a mobile device.
2. The website designed as of now only contains a few artists, albums, and songs, but this will be extended to a huge database in the later stages of the project when we are allowed to use JavaScript.
3. The recent news section on the home page only shows one news headline and the buttons are non-functional.
4. The search icon in the navigation bar is not yet functional.
5. The user profile and its functionalities have also not yet been implemented.
6. The Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Copyright, Sitemap link, and iMelody socials in the footer are only added for the webpage design.


Most of these will be implemented in the future when we are allowed to use JavaScript.
