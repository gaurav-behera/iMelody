## Assumptions

1. The website is designed to be accessed primarily from desktop or laptop computers (1920x1080), rather than a mobile device.
3. The search page can be used to search for only songs.
4. The user profile and it's functionalities have also not yet been implemented.
5. Featured Artist remains constant and doesn't update every week.
6. The playlist page has been implemented as the liked songs page.
7. The reviews and ratings are not stored in any database and refreshing the page empties all previous reviews.
